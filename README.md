# Weather Project
The goal of the project is to predict the weather. This project takes raw data from National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and transforms it into a hyper-channel image (7 channels). Then uses an adapted PredNet architecture to make frame-by-frame image predictions.
